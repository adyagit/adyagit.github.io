Off late, I've been interested in machine learning and computer vision. There are a lot of good resources online to get us started on
these methods. I've been referring so many different blogs that keeping track of them is an effort. 
I was very impressed by the simplicity of Jekyll themed github pages. For static blog pages this works really good. 
Hopefully I can have all my references at one place from now on. 
Happy Exploring !!!
